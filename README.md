Hi gang! mila and i created another page called new story. this will be the page that opens up when we ..um..wanna create...a new story from the homepage. the functionality has been added to the homepage and most of the containers have been added to the new story page, additions to make this work were app.js - a lot of new imports were added from mui in order to bring in the style. ACHTUNG! we need to get in the habit of importing in destructure form and not in so many lines by lines. lets regactor these lines if possible. -->




<!----To work with Mila  -----absolute fail! 
-type in the story and save it into profile(implement the fetch), to array of user & needs to render on the homepage
-We need to create story seeds
-current stuff we have is hardcoded as placeholders, we have framework but its not styled to be horizontal
-we need to pass in Author, story, title, story type,
-implement the carousel? ----absolute fail!

<!-- 5/22 -->
<!-- in Homepage.js, error using useQuery - trying to query public stories, data returns undefined -->

<!-- 5/23 -->
<!-- issue: login wasnt working, create profile wasnt working, = solution dropped db from dbatlas software -->
<!-- fixed login and add profile by resseting db - we created parts for read story component and routes. we need to add parts to the readstory.js for it to stop erroring out -->



<!--------5/23 Patience working with Dru>
We worked on creating an edit button. 
We added a read me button that allows the user to pull there current story up. 

The query needs to be fixed so that the id can determine with story is being read.
