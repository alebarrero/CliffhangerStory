Hi gang! mila and i created another page called new story. this will be the page that opens up when we ..um..wanna create...a new story from the homepage. the functionality has been added to the homepage and most of the containers have been added to the new story page, additions to make this work were app.js - a lot of new imports were added from mui in order to bring in the style. ACHTUNG! we need to get in the habit of importing in destructure form and not in so many lines by lines. lets regactor these lines if possible. -->

We added an HTML <form> in the addstory page in order to try to add title, email, and an actual story to see if the save would button would work and to connect it to database. 
We can add a Title, and Email but now we have to debug on the content because the content is not able to get a value. In the console log we can see it picks up the title, and email, but we cant type in the story. 
Once we have this debugged we will be able to move forward and put into mutations in order to connect to database.
